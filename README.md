# CropCare ðŸŒ±

**CropCare** is an intelligent farming assistant designed to enhance agricultural practices. Built using **Flutter** and powered by **TensorFlow Lite**, the app offers two primary features:

1. **Plant Disease Detection** - Identify diseases in crops using image-based local ML models.
2. **Crop Recommendation** - Suggest the best crop to plant based on soil and environmental conditions.

This app leverages a lightweight on-device machine learning model to provide **accurate results** with minimal latency.
